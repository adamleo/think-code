# How to turn PRO as an amateur programmer.

Some things before the main topic:

- **Capitalise on COVID-19 quarantine**
    - **Create something** that can **help people**.
    - **Learn something new**.

- **Rules for this series**
    - To be helpful to you, so you can learn something new.
    - Most tutorials jump right into tech stuff with jargons, we talk about tech stuff using metaphors that everyone understands.
    - It will be as simple as possible, no tech knowledge required to watch this video series.
    - When I started coding I got scared, but I started anyway because I loved it, and turns out I still love it.
    - Some videos would involve a tiny bit of code, but it's totally fine if you don't understand it.
    - Inspire you that everything is connected, programming is not that different.

# Main Topic

- **Coding is not mysterious. It's simply about delivering results to the user.**
    - Coding is about INPUTs & OUTPUTs, manipulate INPUTs to produce OUTPUTs.
    - It's the same as chefs, drivers, writers.

- **Coding is about creating logics.**
    - Coding is about explaining logic to computers.

- **Programming languages are for humans, not machines.**
    - Coding with any programming language is basically explaining the “how to” to yourself with the correct syntax.
    - Every time the code runs, it's translated into machine language is for computers to understand.
    - It’s like writing down recipe, a clear map/list of what happens at what time.
    - But which programming language should you choose to begin with? It's doesn't matter. Because:

- **All programming languages share the same principles.**
    - Python, Java, C++, golang, etc.
    - Different languages were designed with different purposes
        - Javascript is universal
        - Python is powerful
        - C# is fast
        - Golang is well rounded
    - But there are some exceptions, like:
        - HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
        - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
        - These are technically not "programming" languages.
    - JavaScript is kinda unique
        - It’s a dynamic language
        - It can run on the both frontend & backend.
        - You can do SO many things with it.
        - And it's the most used programming language as of I published this video, so we use it here.

- **Follow your interests**
    - Think about what are your interests
        - Algorithms, AI, fancy websites, or sensors & hardwares
    - Decide what language to use base on what your interests are
        - Algorithms: Javascript & Python are good choices
        - AI: most probably Python is the best
        - Pretty websites: HTML & CSS & JS should be a good combo to start with
        - ...
    - Start with something easy, with small ideas, and then gradually increase the complexity
    - Programs are chains of functions, different chains of functions are called base on different scenario
    - Later you come up with real life ideas, and create apps for them, this is better than mockup projects you do in tutorials
    - You will encounter obstacles, learn from them, they are part of the process, and it trains your ability to learn as well.

- **Your knowledge can be transferred to another language**
    - When you start, learn 1 programming language extremely well, you will build solid foundation regardless the language, and this foundation will serve you well for life.
- **The commodity (INPUTs & OUTPUTs) in coding is data**
    - 2 most basic data types: Numbers and Strings (Technically strings are represented by numbers, but it doesn't matter at the beginning).
    - There are other data types, i.e. arrays, objects, they can be treated as they are built on top of strings and numbers
    - Your job is to create functions to transform the input data into desired output.

# End

- **Be confident, get creative, be crazy**
    - Everything you see/use on your phone, on your computer, is created by someone using one language or another, you can create it too.
    - It takes time, but it’s absolutely achievable.

- **INPUT -> Manipulation -> OUTPUT**
    - Everything in life can be analysed in the “INPUT -> Manipulation -> OUTPUT” framework
    - With this in mind, it will be much easier for you to come up with ideas to create apps with.
    - Think of things that have particular INPUTs & OUTPUTs, you can automate the Manipulation part

- **Computer Science is a way of thinking, it's not only about writing code.**
    - It's not just about dealing with computers, it's more about systematic thinking.
    - Optimise everything, imagine everything.
    - Coding is not boring, it's a whole new world, there are so many things to discover in the coding world.
    - It might seem boring, it's likely you need to work for long hours. But it’s a rewarding process if you’re in the flow.
    - The nerdy stereotype of programmers people have is not true, doing tedious office jobs is more boring than coding, because in these kinds of jobs, there’s no way for you to express creativity

- **Experiences Matter**
    - Go out and experience things, let them inspire you, and use code to bring your ideas to life!!!

Mentions: Programming books are a great way to program your mind, but there are so many great resources online, so you may not need them.
